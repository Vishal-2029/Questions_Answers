## Horizontal and Vertical Scaling

  - What is Scaling?
    
     `Scaling is the process of increasing or decreasing the capacity of a system to handle more or less workload based on demand.`

 - What is Horizontal Scale?
   
     `Horizontal Scale means involves adding more servers to distribute the load.`
     `Use For Cloud environments and distributed systems.`

   - Pros:
    
      `No single point of failure.`
      `Chepates Prices`
      `More Limits`

   - Cons:

     `More complex to manage`
     `Requires distributed architecture.`


 - What is Vertical Scale?
   
     `Involves upgrading the existing server `
     `Use For Single applications`

   - Pros:
    
      `Simpler to implement`
      `No need to manage multiple servers.`

   - Cons:

     `Has a limit `
     `Less Power `
     `Easy Implementation`
