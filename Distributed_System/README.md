# Distributed System

  - What is a Distributed System?
    
     `The Distributed system is a network of a independent computers that work together to appear as a single to user.`
    
     `These Computers are  communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal.`

  - Example :

    `Blackchain`,`Internet`,`Google Search Engine`,`Online Banking Systems` etc...

 - Why use of Distributed System?

   `For improve performance, scalability, high availability and fault tolerance, process large-scale data efficiently`

 - How to Work Distributed System?

   `Multiple Nodes connected with a network. those node communicate and coordinate via protocols. Work is divided among nodes to achieve parallel processing. Nodes share data and synchronize to maintain consistency. If one node fails, others take over the tasks to ensure reliability. `

 - What is the Benefits of Distributed Systems?

   `Scalability`,`Improved Performance`,`Resource Sharing`,`Flexibility` etc...

## Distributed System vs Centralized System

| Feature          | Distributed System                                      | Centralized System                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | A system where multiple computers (nodes) work together as a single unit. | A system where all processing and data storage occur on a single central server. |
| **Architecture** | Multiple interconnected nodes. | Single central server controlling all operations. |
| **Scalability**  | Easily scalable by adding more nodes. | Limited scalability due to dependency on a single system. |
| **Fault Tolerance** | High fault tolerance; if one node fails, others can take over. | Low fault tolerance; if the central server fails, the entire system goes down. |
| **Performance**  | High performance due to parallel processing. | Performance bottlenecks as all processing happens in one place. |
| **Data Storage** | Data is distributed across multiple nodes. | All data is stored in one central location. |
| **Reliability**  | More reliable due to redundancy and data replication. | Less reliable as a single failure can bring down the entire system. |
| **Latency**      | Lower latency as tasks can be processed closer to users. | Higher latency as all requests go to a single server. |
| **Security**     | More complex security management due to multiple nodes. | Easier to secure but more vulnerable to a single point of attack. |
| **Examples**     | Google Search, Blockchain, Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure). | Traditional banking systems, Small business servers, Local databases. |
